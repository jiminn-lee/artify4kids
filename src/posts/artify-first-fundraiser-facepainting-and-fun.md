Artify recently hit a huge milestone: we held our very first fundraiser! Last June, we invited families from all over the Bay Area to Raynor Park, where we arranged a great deal of arts and crafts activities for children to enjoy, with many varieties to suit every artistic interest.<br /><br />
In our best efforts to make this event a true success, volunteers were invited to the park the day before to prepare as well as socialize. It was an entertaining day, full of hilarious antics and conversations as we painted each others’ faces!<br /><br />
On the day of the event, the face painting station quickly became a fan favorite, where children eagerly lined up to get a unique design adorned on their face, ranging from rainbow flamingos to cartoon characters to colorful linework. Our skilled volunteers had a blast transforming their little faces into living canvases, as well as interacting with the kids!<br /><br />

Meanwhile, other kids flocked to the arts and crafts table, where they worked with full artistic freedom. Many chose to meticulously craft paper plate animals, turning the area into a personified rainforest, ocean, and desert all at once with unique creatures! Similarly, imagination ran rampant while young artists drew and colored to their heart’s content. They even got the chance to use Artify coloring pages featuring Colby (you can grab your own by downloading the pages on our website!) Finally, children also had the opportunity to fold their own intricate origami crafts, which sprouted a competition between kids and volunteers to make the farthest-flying paper airplane.<br /><br />
With an event so different from our previous ones, we at Artify feel a great wave of appreciation for all the support we have gotten so far. Children, parents, and volunteers alike shared excitement in exploring the boundless creativity that comes with art. In the words of Katherine Spray, one volunteer that participated, “Seeing the true delight on their faces was really fun…[it was] something special.” A sensation we all felt, this event was incredibly special in making fond and exciting memories for everyone involved to look back on.<br /><br />
With such a memorable experience, we hope to recreate this atmosphere in our future events, and we can only do this with your support! Keep an eye out for upcoming opportunities to volunteer as well as new events to attend, both of which we post regularly on our mailing list, social media, and calendar. We hope to see you soon!
