This Earth Day, Artify hosted a hands-on leaf printing activity at Raynor Park, as children connected with nature while also learning about the environment through art.<br /><br />
That afternoon, young artists gathered at tables stocked with drawing supplies and paper ready to use at their disposal. Guided by our volunteers, they explored the park, scavenging for leaves of various shapes and sizes to use for their very own leaf prints.<br /><br />
With bright markers and crayons, students traced and colored over their leaves, pressing them onto their blank papers. Eventually, each page was filled with vibrant pigment and artful textures traced from the plants they used. Some children chose to experiment with different techniques, layering multiple prints to make an illustration full of unique textures. Meanwhile, other students opted for more elaborate compositions, printing and arranging their leaves in such a way that they designed a bouquet of leaves, as well as a garden of flowers, each petal consisting of several individual leaf prints.<br /><br />

Through every child’s project was a visualized perspective of what the Earth means to them. Seeing the various designs of each finished piece made us reflect on our own perceptions of the scenery, and the intricate variety of life in every nook and cranny of our environment. For Artify volunteers and students alike, the day was a celebration of nature’s endless inspiration and a lasting reminder of the true importance of the environment around us.<br /><br />
