Today at Morning Star on Williams Road, Artify begun their classes starting off with the third graders! The kids drew tigers, led by Co-President Jessica Xiao, traced, and colored them in, following the tigers on the board or the samples created by our volunteers. Then, they cut their tigers out, pasted them to a colored page, and decorated their tiger habitats.<br/><br/>
The kids had a blast, naming their tigers, creating unique patterns, and even adding claws to "intimidate" other tigers. They bonded with the volunteers, introducing themselves and sharing their favorite K-pop artists, notable ones being BlackPink and Stray Kids.<br/><br/>
"It was super fun, and I really enjoyed teaching [the] kids and guiding them the project," Co-President Grace Huang recounts. "We wanted to give them the best first impression and were actually kind of worried if they would get into it. But they did, and I heard one kid asking if there would be more classes."<br/><br/>
The class started at 5 and ended around 6, with the kids taking home any unfinished works to bring to their classes tomorrow, where the teacher will display them on the wall.
