Artify is more than just about teaching kids how to paint pretty pictures; we also focus on spreading a love for art and exploring culture. On Friday, March 22nd, our team had the privilege of participating in an incredible multicultural event at a Fammatre Elementary School, where we took the children on an artistic journey through the wonders of a country rich in history, tradition, and art: China.<br /><br />
At our station, we displayed a vibrant board decorated with images and fascinating tidbits about China. We delved into discussions about Chinese customs, landmarks, and even basic Mandarin phrases as we introduced young visitors to our hands-on activities. Guided by our enthusiastic members, the children embarked on to mold and shape their very own Chinese dragons out of clay, pom-poms, pipe cleaners, and other mixed-media materials.<br /><br />
But the excitement didn't stop there; equipped with paper plates, colorful markers, and loads of googly eyes, the children went to work decorating their own dragon heads. We also introduced the children to the art of traditional Chinese fan-making. With paper and folding techniques, they designed fans adorned with carefully colored designs. The children also enjoyed delicious Chinese rice crackers as they completed their art pieces. Both the volunteers and young artists were left satisfied as the children proudly displayed their unique masterpieces.<br /><br />
The event was also filled with many other presentations and performances of various cultures and countries. Not only was this an educational opportunity for the kids, but it was also a learning moment for Artify members as well. When describing her experience with the event, Co-President Grace Huang shared how she “really enjoyed helping the children” and considered the event to be “an experience for both the volunteers and the children to grow.”<br /><br />
As we look ahead to future events, we plan to continue to spread the joy of learning art and culture. We hope to see you there as we pursue our mission of education and creativity!<br /><br />
