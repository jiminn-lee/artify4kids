On Friday, September 29, Artify officially had its first event at John Muir Elementary School's Mid-Autumn Festival. Our volunteers began setting up our booth at around 3:45, putting up the tablecloth, preparing the posters, and laying out the cookies. We began preparing the bubble and paint mixture for the activity at around 4:00 and making samples.<br/><br/>
At around 4:45, parents and children began to trickle in, attracted by our bright poster and bubbles floating around the booth. After a quick explanation by our volunteers, the children were individually guided through the process, picking out their favorite colors in the small containers. As they blew bubbles into the container and pressed it carefully onto their paper, they were elated as they saw bright their red and blue bubbles create a pattern of overlapping circles. As the festival reached its peak, we had up to 7 kids at a time blowing bubbles to their heart's content, some refusing to leave until their paper was covered in paint. Some brought multiple containers together and pressed all three colors down at the same time, creating a beautiful blend of colors. They left their paper with us to dry, coming back later to retrieve their now-dry works. After it was dry, they used gel pens to add their own designs following the circular patterns, some drawing a rabbit in a circle in the spirit of the Mid-Autumn Festival.<br/><br/>
After the kids finished with their masterpieces, some went to our snack station and bought homemade chocolate chip cookies made by our PR Leader, Sophia Xie, or classic Chinese crackers brought by our Co-President, Jessica Xiao.<br/><br/>
We closed our booth at around 8:00 p.m., and our volunteers were exhausted but satisfied with their work. After the event, one of our volunteers recounts how "[the booth] was a great success that left kids smiling and laughing. Kids of all ages got to create fun and unique pieces of art that were one of a kind" and how she "had a blast hosting this booth."<br/><br/>
We hope you will be there for our next event, whether you are a volunteer or a participant!
