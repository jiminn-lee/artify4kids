		question: 'Can parents stay for lessons?',
		answer:
			'Yes, parents can stay for all of our lessons out of concern for the safety of their child. However, we would prefer to have parents leave their children alone, especially for the older kids, as it allows them to express themselves more freely and make friends faster without worry of parent supervision. Rest assured, your kid will receive excellent care and will come back to you happy and healthy- We will stay behind until every single kid has been picked up!'

		question: 'Are the lessons free?',
		answer:
			'Yes, as a philanthropic organization, all our lessons and classes offered are free. We do not profit off of any of our donations, which all go into planning and buying materials for our lessons.'
